## Getting Started and Setup

Running the project requires NodeJS installed. I don't believe you need the extra scripts. So just installing NodeJS is fine. From here navigate to the frontend folder and run the following command. If something fails contact me on Discord or ensure you have a modern version of npm.

```bash
npm install
```

You should now be good to run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
